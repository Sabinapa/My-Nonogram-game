# Welcome to the MY NONOGRAM Game

**Game Dynamics:**

Nonogram, also known as "Picross" or "Griddlers," is a logic puzzle that involves creating pictures by filling in cells based on numerical clues.
The game entails solving a grid of square cells where some cells are filled, while others remain empty. 
The objective is to reveal a hidden image or pattern by following the instructions given in the form of numbers at the top and left sides of the grid. 
The numbers represent sequences of adjacent filled cells in each row or column.

**Game Mechanics:**

Players begin by analyzing the numbers on the edges of the grid, which provide information on how the filled cells are arranged in each row and column. 
With this information, players mark or fill in the corresponding cells, employing logical reasoning and iterative solving to gradually uncover the hidden picture. Connecting information from different parts of the grid leads to the progressive revelation of the entire image. 
It is crucial to use logic and deduction to correctly fill and unveil the entire picture.

**Game Elements:**

The main elements of the game include a grid of square cells, numbers along the edges of the grid providing clues about patterns of filled cells, and a player tool for marking or coloring cells. 
Numbers are essential for understanding how many cells in a particular row or column are filled, their order, and whether there are empty cells among them. 

The game often offers various difficulty levels, from easy to challenging puzzles, allowing players of all experience levels to engage in solving nonograms.

# Welcome to the MY NONOGRAM Game ðŸ§©

Nonogram, also known as "Picross" or "Griddlers," is a logic puzzle that involves creating pictures by filling in cells based on numerical clues.

## **Game Dynamics:** ðŸŒŸ
The game entails solving a grid of square cells where some cells are filled, while others remain empty. 
The objective is to reveal a hidden image or pattern by following the instructions given in the form of numbers at the top and left sides of the grid. 
The numbers represent sequences of adjacent filled cells in each row or column.

## **Game Mechanics:** ðŸŒˆ

Players begin by analyzing the numbers on the edges of the grid, which provide information on how the filled cells are arranged in each row and column. 
With this information, players mark or fill in the corresponding cells, employing logical reasoning and iterative solving to gradually uncover the hidden picture. Connecting information from different parts of the grid leads to the progressive revelation of the entire image. 
It is crucial to use logic and deduction to correctly fill and unveil the entire picture.

- Grid: The game is played on a grid of square cells.

- Numbers: Numerical clues are provided along the edges of the grid, indicating the sequences of adjacent filled cells in each row or column.

- Cell Marking: Players can mark or fill in cells based on the information provided by the numerical clues.

- Logical Reasoning: Players use logical reasoning to analyze the relationships between the numbers and determine the arrangement of filled cells.
